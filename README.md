## Advent of Code 2024

Each day (apart from day 1), a randomizer will pick a language for me to solve that days Advent of Code challenge. The goal is to learn new languages and to see how they compare to each other.
I will probably not be able to finish each days task on time, but I will try to finish them all eventually.
