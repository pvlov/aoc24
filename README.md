## Advent of Code 2024

Each day (apart from day 1), a randomizer will pick a language for me to solve that days Advent of Code challenge. The goal is to learn new languages and to see how they compare to each other.
I will probably not be able to finish each days task on time, but I will try to finish them all eventually.

| Day | Programming Language |
| --- | -------------------- |
| 1   | Rust                 |
| 2   | Ruby                 |
| 3   | PHP                  |

The randomizer will pick a language from the following list:

- C
- C++
- Python
- Java
- Kotlin
- Scala
- Elixir
- OCaml
- Haskell
- Swift
- Go
- TypeScript
- Lua
- Gleam
- Julia
- Zig

- Perl
- Ada
- Erlang
- Dart
